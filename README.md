# VstarCamDownloader
Download video data from a Vstarcam Smart Camera, from the SD Card over a local network.

# Please note
Vstarcam's firmware has been recently updated so whenever the device has booted up it will choose a random port for the web interface to run on. To statically assign a port, please download the program named 'IP Camera Finder' (http://www.eye4.so/download/) and configure the device to use a static IP, this will allow you to choose the necessary port for the web interface to run on, for example port 80.
